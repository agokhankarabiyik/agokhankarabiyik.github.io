Although I believe that _"Nothing is as it seems"_, you are about to witness both how I see the world and how I try to teach computers how to see the world. Hopefully, mostly the latter.

**A little more about me:**

I knew that I was into coding and quite enjoying it during my undergrad years as a Chemical Engineering student; however, I, somehow, didn't have the chance to deep dive into it. 

I think it wouldn't be wrong to say that my "digital transformation" started almost 2 years ago (May 2017) when I decided to take the Data Science course at General Assembly. It was so fortunate that I was taught by Greg Baker who is an amazing human-being with amazing machine learning skills. One day, he mentioned Computer Vision followed by Dr. Adrian Rosebrock and his courses & books. I must admit that I was highly intrigued with the topic; however, all I could do at that time being was to include a few lines of computer vision related codes into my Capstone Project and complete the DS course.

Then, the course ended and I landed a Data Science job. It wasn't until later, the itch for computer vision made me enrol in Adrian's PyimageSearch course followed by his Deep Learning for Computer Vision books. I learned a lot about computer vision from scratch; I was inspired by his work and established a mindset to decide how to attack a problem. Therefore, a big shoutout to Adrian and his team for making the process as smooth as possible for me and many others! 

Finally, here I am. Still learning, and I believe it will never come to an end; it shouldn't anyway. So please, feel free to join me in this lifelong learning journey of mine.

Last but not least, I live in Sydney - Australia! If you need me, just say G'day! :)
